DESCRIPTION
===========

The _fcgi_ package is a wrapper for the _FastCGI library_
<URL:http://www.fastcgi.com>. The wrapper is based on version 2.4.1 of the
FastCGI library. It is written using critcl 3.

The package tries to stay close to the C calls in the FastCGI library
application server API. Consult the _FastCGI library documentations_
<URL:http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/node/6> for more details about the wrapped
API functions and data structures.

The _fcgi_ package code can be found on _GitHub_
<URL:http://github.com/jdc8/tclfcgi>.

_fcgi_ commands
===============

    fcgi Init

        Initialize the FCGX library. Must be called before calling the Accept_r
        command.

    fcgi OpenSocket path ?backlog?

        Create a FastCGI listen socket.

        The path arguments can be a Unix domain socket, a Windows named pipe, or
        a colon followed by a port number.

        The backlog argument is the listen queue depth used in the _listen()_
        call. Default value is 5.

        The socket file descriptor is returned.

    fcgi CloseSocket socket

        Close the FastCGI listen socket.

    fcgi InitRequest socket ?flags?

        Initialize a _FCGX_Request_ structure for use with Accept_r.

        The socket argument is the file descriptor as returned by the OpenSocket
        command.

        the flags argument is specified as an integer. Default value is 0.

        A _FCGX_Request_ handle is returned.

    fcgi Free request close

        Frees the memory allocated by the _FCGX_Request_ structure. If the close
        close is true, the associated stream are closed too.

    fcgi Accept_r request

        Accept a new request.

    fcgi Finish_r request

        Finish the request.

    fcgi GetParam request ?name?

        _stdout_ and _stderr_.

    fcgi GetStr request stream n

        Read n consecutive bytes from the specified stream. The string is
